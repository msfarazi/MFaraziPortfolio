    <p>
      My name is Maren, and I am a junior in high school. I go to <del>public</del> <ins>private</ins> school. I love hanging out with friends, as well as spending time with family. I love traveling, with my favorite trips being 
      to France and Hawaii. I have played volleyball since I was eleven, and made many great memories through the sport. As for work, I
      tutor a couple different families. I get a lot of value out of tutoring, so I really enjoy my job.
