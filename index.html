    <p>
      My name is Maren, and I am a junior in high school. I go to <del>public</del><ins>private</ins>school. I have a mom, a dad, and two younger 
      siblings. My brother is eighteen months younger than me, and my sister is six years younger than me. I also have a dog, who is almost 
      five years old. I love hanging out with friends, as well as spending time with family. I love traveling, with my favorite trips being 
      to France and Hawaii. I have played volleyball since I was eleven, and made many great memories through the sport. As for work, I
      tutor a couple different families. I get a lot of value out of tutoring, so I really enjoy my job.
